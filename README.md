* **Submenus:** Menu items with subcategories open a submenu on click. 
* **Accessibility:** The tab system allows users to navigate using the keyboard for improved accessibility. 
* **Swiper carousels:** Featured items in the mobile menu and desktop view are displayed in swiper carousels for easy browsing.
* **Optional announcement bar:** A hidden announcement bar can be enabled/disabled and closed by the user.  

**Instructions:**

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the interactive menu.

**Technical Notes:**

* The code utilizes various libraries for functionalities:
    * Swiper.js for creating carousels ([https://swiperjs.com/swiper-api](https://swiperjs.com/swiper-api))
